# SeattleTestbed/common isn't really a standalone component, 
# it's part of the build harness for the other repos. Therefore, 
# there are no non-`test` directives.
#
# It is unit-testable however, and here is what we need for this:
test ./*
test DEPENDENCIES/utf/*
test tests/*
common/*
common/utf/*
repy_v2/*
# Tests
test ../tests/*
# Trees
tree ../tree/*
# Subdir
seattlelib_v2/* subdir_seattlelib_v2/v2/*
test repy_v2/* subdir_repy_v2/v2/*
